The Financial District is rich in history, overlapping the boundaries of the New Amsterdam (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Amsterdam) settlement in the late 17th century. During the day, the population of this area swells to about 300,000. Federal Hall National Memorial (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Hall), on the site of the first US Capitol (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol) and the inauguration (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inauguration) of George Washington (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington) as the first President of the United States (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States), is located at the corner of Wall Street and Nassau Street (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassau_Street_%28Manhattan%29). Other tourist attractions include the adjacent South Street Seaport (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Street_Seaport) Historic District, New York City Police Museum (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Museum), and Museum of American Finance (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_of_American_Finance). Although the term is sometimes used as a synonym for \"Wall Street (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street)\", the latter term is often applied metonymously (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metonym) to the financial markets as a whole, whereas \"the Financial District\" implies an actual geographical location. According to City of New York official data, the neighborhood is named Wall Street."

The 9/11 terrorist attacks had a major impact on Battery Park City. The residents of lower Manhattan and particularly of Battery Park City were displaced for ten days. Upon return, the air in the area was still filled with toxic smoke from the World Trade Center fires that persisted until January 2002. The neighborhood, which is the site of the World Financial Center (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Financial_Center) along with numerous housing, commercial and retail buildings, is named for adjacent Battery Park (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_Park_%28New_York%29)"

                "description": "The name is an acronym (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym) based on the words \"Triangle below Canal Street\". The neighborhood is home to the Tribeca Film Festival (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribeca_Film_Festival). The area was among the first residential neighborhoods developed in New York beyond the boundaries of the city during colonial times, with residential development beginning in the late 18th century. By the mid-19th century the area transformed into a commercial center, with large numbers of store and loft buildings constructed along Broadway in the 1850s and 1860s. Tribeca suffered financially after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11,_2001_terrorist_attacks), but government grants and incentives helped the area rebound fairly quickly. The Tribeca Film Festival (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribeca_Film_Festival) was established to help contribute to the long-term recovery of lower Manhattan after 9/11, but also celebrates New York City as a major filmmaking center. Today, Tribeca is one of America's most fashionable and desirable neighborhoods and is known for its celebrity residents. In 2006 Forbes (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes) magazine ranked its 10013 zip code as New York City's most expensive."

Chinese immigrants originally came here to find work as \"cigar men\", after Ah Ken, the first Chinese person to permanently live here, who had a successful cigar store on Park Row (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Row_(Manhattan)). The early days of Chinatown were dominated by Chinese \"tongs (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tong_(gang))\", which were a mixture of clan associations, political alliances and crime syndicates. The associations, aligned with their own street gang, started to give protection from harassment due to anti-Chinese sentiment. In the years after the United States enacted the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_Nationality_Act_of_1965), allowing many more immigrants from Asia into the country, the population of Chinatown exploded. Unlike most other urban Chinatowns, Manhattan's Chinatown is both a residential area as well as commercial area. Many population estimates are in the range of 90,000 to 100,000 residents. In 2010, Little Italy and Chinatown were listed in a single historic district (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historic_district_(United_States)) on the National Register of Historic Places (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places)."

                "description": "This area was originally home to the pre-Revolutionary farm of James Delancey (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_DeLancey_(politician)), and in response to the pressure of a growing city, the farm was confiscated shortly after the Revolution. Traditionally an immigrant, working class (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_class) neighborhood, the Lower East Side has undergone rapid gentrification (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentrification) since 2005. This prompted The National Trust for Historic Preservation (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_National_Trust_for_Historic_Preservation) to place the neighborhood on their list of America's Most Endangered Places (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America%27s_Most_Endangered_Places). American Jews relate to the neighborhood in a particularly strong manner. In the late twentieth century, the strong pull of the Lower East Side on the imagination of American Jews led to the preservation of a number of buildings associated with the Jewish immigrant community. The Lower East Side Tenement Museum (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_East_Side_Tenement_Museum) is a popular tourist destination, exploring the history of the neighborhood. Today, the Lower East Side has become a home to upscale boutiques and trendy dining establishments along Clinton Street's restaurant row."

The neighborhood has become a center of the counterculture (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterculture) in New York, and is known as the birthplace and historical home of many artistic movements, including punk rock (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punk_rock), and the Nuyorican (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuyorican) literary movement. It is still known for its diverse community, with vibrant nightlife and artistic sensibility, but in recent decades gentrification (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentrification) has somewhat changed the character of the neighborhood."

Alphabet City became home to a succession (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_succession_theory) of immigrant (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigrant) groups over the years. By the 1840s and 1850s, much of present-day Alphabet City had become known as \"Little Germany (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Germany,_New_York)\". By the middle of the 20th century, Alphabet City was again in transition, as thousands of Puerto Ricans (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rican_American) began to settle in the neighborhood, making it an important site for the development and strengthening of Puerto Rican cultural identity in New York. Avenues A through D became distinctly less bohemian (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemianism) in the 21st century than they had been in earlier decades, and formerly abandoned buildings are now bustling with new restaurants, nightclubs and retail establishments."

What provided the initial attractive character of the community eventually contributed to its gentrification (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentrification) and commercialization. Greenwich Village has long been a popular neighborhood for numerous artists and other notable people."

Prior to construction, the neighborhood contained eighteen city blocks, with public schools, churches, factories, private homes, apartments, small businesses, and even relatively new modern-style apartment buildings. As part of one of the city's many urban renewal (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_renewal) projects, some 11,000 persons were forced to move from the neighborhood, championed by Parks Commissioner Robert Moses. To much controversy, Moses sought \"to induce insurance companies and savings banks to enter the field of large-scale  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Moses)slum clearance (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slum_clearance).\" Stuyvesant Town's planning (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_planning) and design were met with haste as to how the project was approved and the lack of public participation in the process; the project's population density; the absence of any public facilities such as schools, community centers, or shops in the development. On October 17, 2006, MetLife agreed to sell Stuyvesant Town—Peter Cooper Village to Tishman Speyer Properties (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tishman_Speyer_Properties) for $5.4 billion. In January 2010, Tishman Speyer Properties defaulted on the mortgage. It was the largest commercial mortgage default in U.S. history. On January 24, 2010, Tishman Speyer Properties gave up control of the properties by handing the complex to creditors."

The Toy Center (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy_Center) buildings at 23rd Street and Broadway date from this period, and the annual American International Toy Fair (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_International_Toy_Fair) took place there beginning in 1903, except for 1945. When much of this business moved outside the U.S., the area began to be referred to as the Photo District. Giving this area a bit of color are the Museum of Sex (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_of_Sex) and the Gershwin Hotel, both located on 27th Street. The Gershwin is a tribute to the late pop artist Andy Warhol (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Warhol), and features some of his art and memorabilia throughout the hotel."

Kips Bay was the site of the Landing at Kip's Bay (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_at_Kip%27s_Bay) (September 15, 1776), an episode of the American Revolutionary War (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War) and part of the New York and New Jersey campaign (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_and_New_Jersey_campaign). About 4,000 British Army (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army) troops under General (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_%28United_Kingdom%29) William Howe (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Howe,_5th_Viscount_Howe) landed at Kips Bay on September 15, 1776, near what is now the foot of East 33rd Street. The neighborhood has been rebuilt in patches, so one can see both new high-rise structures often set back from the street, and a multitude of exposed party walls that were never meant to be seen in public. A nearly forgotten feature is the private alley, Broadway Alley, between 26th and 27th Streets, halfway between Lexington and Third Avenues, reputedly the last unpaved street in Manhattan. Since the late 1990s, the area has had a commercial strip mall, referred to as \"Kips Bay Plaza\"."

Since then, rent prices have increased enormously, and many famous entertainers have resided here, including Burt Reynolds (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burt_Reynolds), Bob Hope (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Hope), James Dean (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Dean), and Jerry Seinfeld (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Seinfeld). During the 1950s, immigrants, notably Puerto Ricans (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rican_people), moved into the neighborhood. The conflict between the Irish, Italians, and the Puerto Ricans is highlighted in West Side Story (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Side_Story_%28musical%29). The movie (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Side_Story_%28film%29) was filmed from 65th Street and 69th Street between Amsterdam and West End Avenue, north of Hell's Kitchen."

                "description": "Once a bastion of poor and working-class Irish Americans (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_American), Hell's Kitchen has changed over the last three decades of the 20th century and into the new millennium because it is near Midtown (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midtown_Manhattan). It now provides transportation, hospital and warehouse infrastructure support to the Midtown business district. Its gritty reputation kept real estate prices below those of most other areas of Manhattan until the early 1990s. Since then, rent prices have increased enormously, and many famous entertainers have resided here, including Burt Reynolds (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burt_Reynolds), Bob Hope (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Hope), James Dean (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Dean), and Jerry Seinfeld (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Seinfeld). During the 1950s, immigrants, notably Puerto Ricans (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rican_people), moved into the neighborhood. The conflict between the Irish, Italians, and the Puerto Ricans is highlighted in West Side Story (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Side_Story_%28musical%29). The movie (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Side_Story_%28film%29) was filmed from 65th Street and 69th Street between Amsterdam and West End Avenue, north of Hell's Kitchen."

Sutton Place encompasses two public parks overlooking the East River, which have undergone much controversy given the close proximity to FDR Drive, a major expressway along Manhattan's eastern edge. One of these parks is, in fact, cantilevered over the expressway. Sutton Place is present in much popular culture, being the famous Dead End (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_End) of the 1935 play and 1937 movie of that name, and mentioned in the novel Catcher in the Rye (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher_in_the_Rye) as the location of a \"swanky\" apartment.

The Upper East Side maintains one of the highest pricing per square foot in the United States. A 2002 report cited the average cost per square foot as $856; however, that price has noticed a substantial jump, increasing to almost as much as $1,200 per square foot as of 2006. The area is host to some of the most famous museums in the world. The string of museums along Fifth Avenue fronting Central Park has been dubbed \"Museum Mile (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_Mile,_New_York).\" It was once named \"Millionaire's Row.\""

Since the 1920s, Harlem has been a major African-American (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American) residential, cultural and business center. Originally a Dutch (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands) village, formally organized in 1658, tt is named after the city of Haarlem (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haarlem) in the Netherlands (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands). Harlem was annexed (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation) to New York City in 1873. Starting in 1946, the largest public works project took place here in East Harlem. Existing structures were torn down for new public housing, with the theory they would present a safer and more pleasant environment. The neighborhood suffers from unemployment (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment) rates higher than the New York average (generally more than twice as high), and high mortality rates as well. With the end of the \"crack wars (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crack_epidemic)\" in the mid 90s and with the initiation of aggressive policing under mayor Rudolph Giuliani (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolph_Giuliani), crime in Harlem plummeted. Many places in Harlem are New York City Landmarks or Registered Historic Places or otherwise prominent."

                "description": "Since the 1920s, this Harlem has been a major African-American (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American) residential, cultural and business center. Originally a Dutch (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands) village, formally organized in 1658, it is named after the city of Haarlem (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haarlem) in the Netherlands (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands). Harlem has been defined by a series of boom-and-bust (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boom-and-bust) cycles, with significant ethnic shifts accompanying each cycle. Black residents began to arrive en masse in 1904, with numbers fed by the Great Migration (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Migration_%28African_American%29). In the 1920s and 1930s, the neighborhood was the focus of the \"Harlem Renaissance (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem_Renaissance)\", an outpouring of artistic and professional works without precedent in the American black community. After years of false starts, Harlem began to see rapid gentrification (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentrification) in the late 1990s, and in 2010, blacks ceased to be a majority of the population. There have been rallies against gentrification. Though Harlem musicians and writers are particularly well remembered, the community has also hosted numerous actors and theater companies. The New Heritage Repertory Theater, National Black Theater, and the Apollo Theater (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Theater) are all located here."

Situated near the famous Bloomingdale Road, its hotels, houses of entertainment and post office made it an alluring destination of suburban retreat from the city. With the construction of road and railway viaducts over the valley in which the town sat, Manhattanville, increasingly absorbed into the growing city, became a marginalized industrial area. The neighborhood is now the site of a major planned expansion of Columbia University (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University), which has campuses in Morningside Heights to the south and Washington Heights (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Heights,_Manhattan) to the north."

Most of the housing here dates from the extension of the elevated and subway lines at the end of the 19th and the start of the 20th Century. The brownstone revival of the 1960s and 1970s led to a new movement of middle-class blacks in the area. Latinos arrived in large numbers in the 1980s, with Dominicans making up the majority. Today the local population is changing again, with Hispanics (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic) constituting a majority of the population. Many actors, artists, teachers, and other professionals now reside in Hamilton Heights. Hamilton Heights is the home of City College of New York (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_College_of_New_York) (CCNY), Dance Theatre of Harlem (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_Theatre_of_Harlem), The Harlem School of the Arts (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Harlem_School_of_the_Arts) and Aaron Davis Hall."

                "description": "Manhattan's highest natural elevation, 265 ft (80.8 m) above sea level (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level), at what was the location of Fort Washington, is located here. This played a critical role during the Battle of Fort Washington (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Fort_Washington), which occurred on November 16, 1776, when the fort fell to the British at great cost to American forces. Over the years, the area has been home to Irish immigrants, European Jews escaping Nazism, and later many Greeks. The community was often referred to as the \"Astoria (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astoria,_Queens) of Manhattan.\" In the 1980s, the area was severely affected by the crack cocaine epidemic (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crack_Epidemic), much of this attributed to the rampant gang activity of the time. By the 2000s, urban renewal began, along with white gentrification (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentrification). Today, the majority of the population is of Dominican (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Republic) birth or descent, and is one Manhattan's safest neighborhoods. There are many noted sites in the area, including The Paul Robeson Home (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Robeson_Home), and the Audubon Ballroom (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audubon_Ballroom), where Malcolm X (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_X) was assassinated during a speech."

                "description": "Inwood is the northernmost neighborhood on the island of Manhattan, but not the northernmost neighborhood of the borough of Manhattan. That distinction is held by Marble Hill (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marble_Hill,_Manhattan,_New_York), situated just north of Inwood. Because of its water boundary on three sides, the hilly geography, and the limited local street connections, the neighborhood can feel somewhat physically detached from the rest of the borough. Inwood is very large in area for a Manhattan neighborhood, and its real estate is sharply bifurcated between east and west. The districts east of Broadway are of lower-income and Spanish-speaking. This area is also more industrial and commercial and has few parks and trees. Inwood Hill Park (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inwood_Hill_Park), on the Hudson River, is known for its caves (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave) that were used by the Lenape (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenape) before Europeans arrived, and the last salt marsh (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_marsh) in Manhattan. The Cloisters (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cloisters) in Fort Tryon Park (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Tryon_Park), is the area's best known attraction. It is a branch of  the Metropolitan Museum of Art (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art) is devoted to Medieval art (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_art) and culture."

The development of Lincoln Center, and more recently Trump Place (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Place) and other upscale high-rise apartment buildings have brought a measure of gentrification (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentrification) to the western end of Lincoln Square.

Its renaming in July 1918, as a result of anti-German sentiment during World War I, gave impetus to the name \"Lenox Hill\" for the area, doubtless on the analogy of fashionable Murray Hill (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Hill,_Manhattan), though the hospital itself, a city block bounded on the north and south by 77th and 76th streets, and on the west and east by Park and Lexington Avenues, does not stand on former Lenox property."

Known as \"Little Bohemia\" starting in 1916, West Village is the center of the bohemian (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemianism) lifestyle on the West Side, with classic artist's lofts and new residential towers. The neighborhood is distinguished by streets that are \"off the grid\" — set at an angle to the other streets in Manhattan — sometimes confusing both tourists and city residents alike. These roads were laid out in an 18th century  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loft)grid plan (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_plan), approximately parallel or perpendicular to the Hudson, long before the Commissioners' Plan of 1811 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commissioners%27_Plan_of_1811) which created the main street grid plan for later parts of the city."

NoMad's early history is closely aligned with that of Madison Square Park (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Park), which has been a public space since 1686. A commercial boom followed with the growth of hotels, restaurants, entertainment venues and office buildings, many of which are still standing. NoMad is home to the Museum of Sex (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_of_Sex), the New York Comedy Club and Tada! Youth Theater, and is also a center for antique galleries and one of the city’s largest collections of weekend flea markets. Nightspots and clubs include the Breslin Lobby Bar, Jay Z (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Z)’s 40/40, the rooftop bar at 230 Fifth Avenue, Gstaad, Hillstone’s, and the Park Avenue Country Club."

The area eventually developed into a shanty Irish community, and later a high rate of violent crime and a haven for waterfront thieves. Today it is considered to be quite safe.

It was created when dealers moved north from an earlier district near Canal Street (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal_Street_%28Manhattan%29) and the Bowery (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowery), and from the Financial District (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_District,_Manhattan). It grew in importance when the German Nazis (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazis) invaded the Netherlands (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands) and Belgium (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium), forcing thousands of Orthodox Jews (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodox_Jews) in the diamond business to flee to New York City. An estimated 90% of diamonds in the United States enter through this area. Total receipts for the value of a single day's trade on the block average $400 million."

Because of its geography, Marble Hill is often associated with the Bronx; for instance, it is part of two of the Bronx's Community Board Districts. Marble Hill has been occupied since the Dutch colonial (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_colonization_of_the_Americas) period."
